# dynAlloc - Dynamic Memory Allocator

## Description
This is a memory allocator program that dynamically allocates and deallocates the memory in heap on request. Much like how malloc() and free() work.

## Technology Stack
- C++: Memory Allocator is implemented in C++
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Memory Layout of C Program

## Functions Used
| *Function*                              | *Use* |
|:--------------------------------      |:-------------------------|
| struct Block{};                        | Structure of Memory Block |
| using word_t = intptr_t                | Machine specific word size |
| word_t *alloc(size_t size);            | Dynamic Allocator function |
| inline size_t align(size_t n);         | Alignment or Padding function |
| inline size_t allocSize(size_t size);  | Returns total allocation size |
| void free(word_t *data);               | Function to Free the mapped heap |
| Block *requestFromOS(size_t size);     | Function that requests the specified size in HEAP to be allocated using sbrk() call |
| Block *getHeader(word_t *data);        | Returns Header of user data |
| Block *findFreeBlock(size_t size);     | Dynamic Allocation through searching the available block |
